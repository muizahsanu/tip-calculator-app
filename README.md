## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- [React](https://reactjs.org/) - JS library
- [SASS](https://sass-lang.com/)

### What I learned

Change parent style when input is focus useing ":focus-within".

To see how you can add code snippets, see below:

```html
<div class="parent">
  <input type="number" />
</h1>
```
```css
.parent:focus-within {
  outline: 1px solid #000
}
```

### Continued development

I must learn more about react js, I learned using component, but I still confused when should I use component. 

In first in this project challenge I create 2 component. First component is for input form like Bill, Select Tip, and Number of People. And the second component for the output. Everthing is fine, the App.js is clean. But when I create Reset Button, it's only reset the output, I confused how to reset the input too.

After that I start again from 0, but I create a components just for a button, Input Field and Input Field with Icon. It works and everything is fine, but i'm not satisfied.

I'd really appreciate it if you gave any tips or better ways to use components and when should I create a component.

And one thing I want to learn is English. :)

## Acknowledgments

Learn in advance what you are going to make, about how to finish it. What I did was make it right away without planning and studying it first. and in the middle I got into trouble and had to change the code quite a lot. lol
